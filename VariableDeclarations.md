# Variable Declarations
- let and const are preferred for variable declarations
- let and const support block level scoping
- Cannot redeclare variable multiple number of times

# Diff between let and const
- let doesn't need initial declaration but const need
  ```
  let x;
  const y = 1;
  ```
- Once assigned const declaration can't be changed
- But yeah let declaration can be changed
